                  Safe and effective, the igrow is a revolutionary Hair growth
                  system that provides full scalp coverage, simple to use igrow
                  incorporates Apira Science’s dual light Lazer and LED design.
                </p>

                <h5>GROWS HAIR</h5>
                <p>
                  igrow’s proprietary low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT) technology
                  utilizes ahighly effective combinationof red lazer and LED
                  light diodes to effectively stimulate and energize cellular
                  activity causing an uptake in the natural function of the hair
                  follicle. This proven 4 to 6 month process reverses hair
                  thinning and loss.

                  Low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT) has been shown to stop hair
                  loss and help grow hair for menand women with genetic forms of
                  hair loss,such as pattern baldness.
                </p>

                <h5>ABOUT LOW-LEVEL LIGHT THERAPY (LLLT)</h5>
                <p>
                  Lasers are widely used in medicine and also through outa
                  variety of industries in a multitude of varying capacities.
                  The laser energy used to growhair is visible in the red light
                  spectrum. The laser light used in treating hair loss and other
                  medical conditionsis defined as a Low-Level Laser Therapy
                  (LLLT).LLLT is sometimes included under a broader definition
                  of photo-therapy called low-light therapy where the
                  light-emitting device may be a laser and/ora light-emitting
                  diode(LED).
                </p>

                <h5>BEFORE TREATMENT</h5>
                <p>
                  Thinning hair and hairloss is primarily aGenetically driven
                  conditionCalled Androgenetic Alopecia.over time,this condition
                  deconstructsor damages follicle cells and causes hair to
                  progressively thin untilthe hair follicleultimately dies,
                  unable to produce hair again.
                </p>

                <h5>RECIEVING TREATMENT</h5>
                <p>
                  Non-Invasive Low-Level Laser Therapy at a
                  scientificallyestablished and clinically provenwavelength
                  (approximately 655 nano meters) can re-energize unhealthy
                  follicle cells, andcorrespondingly stimulate and stabilizethe
                  production of fuller, thicker and healthier hair.
                </p>

                <h5>AFTER TREATMENT</h5>
                <p>
                  When used consistently,Low-Level Laser Therapyhas been shown
                  to effectivelytreat the primary effects of Androgenetic
                  Alopecia(thinning hair). LLLT can effectively suspend hair
                  loss ,and ultimatelyreturn thin hair to a fuller, thicker
                  andhealthier state.
                </p>
