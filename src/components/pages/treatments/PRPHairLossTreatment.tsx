                  Most adultâ€™s loose about 75 to 100 hair from their scalp
                  everyday where some hairs are in the falling phase (telogen),
                  and some in the growth phase (anagen).
                </p>

                <p>
                  As long as the process remains balanced the number of hair on
                  the scalp remains constant. Any disturbance in this process
                  results in hair loss.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Other factors for hair loss can be metabolic imbalances,
                  illness, stress, nutritional deficiency, pollution and
                  genetics.
                </p>

                <h5>WHAT IS THIS METHOD OF HAIR REGROWTH?</h5>
                <p>
                  It is called platelet rich plasma therapy procedure (PRP).
                </p>

                <p>
                  PRP is a new form of regenerative medicine wherein the
                  patients own blood is utilized and the concentrate helps in
                  hair regrowth.
                </p>

                <h5>HOW DOES PRP WORK?</h5>
                <p>
                  The concentrated platelets in PRP contain tremendous amount of
                  bioactive proteins, which include growth factors. These growth
                  factors initiate tissue repair and have shown to have a
                  positive effect on hair loss.
                </p>

                  and wound repair. The use for skin and hair has been widely
                  researched and the procedure has very good results.
