                  by its delicate nature and thus called sensitive.

                  It frequently reacts adversely to environmental condition and
                  requires special treatment in order to remain in good
                  condition.

                <p>
                  Sensitive skin is prone to pimples, redness, burns, itches,
                  stings, allergies and redness.

                  Sensitive skin reacts adversely to cosmetics containing
                  alcohol, synthetically manufactured oil, fragrant oil,
                  artificial colours. Sensitive skin benefits from gentle
                  skincare products and treatments.
