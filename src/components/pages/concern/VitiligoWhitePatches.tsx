                <h5>VITILIGO</h5>
                <p>
                  This is a skin disorder where one sees a complete pigment loss
                  in the affected areas. This occurs due to the damage of the
                  pigment producing cells (melanocyte). Vitiligo is clinically
                  identified by the development of chalky white macular (flat)
                  patches, which when viewed microscopically are completely
                  devoid of melanocyte.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Vitiligo starts as small white patches, first affecting an
                  area with pigment loss, and then spreading with time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal of treatment is to stop or slow down the progression
                  of pigment loss.
                </p>
                <h5>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:</h5>
                <p>
                  Pigment loss produces milky white patches on conducting a
                  Woodâ€™s light examination. Flat areas of normal-feeling skin
                  without any pigment appear suddenly or gradually. These areas
                  have a darker border. The edges are well-defined but
                  irregular.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Vitiligo most often affects the face, elbows, knees, hands,
                  feet and genitals. But can affect any part of the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Vitiligo is more noticeable in darker-skinned people because
                  of the contrast of white patches against dark skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No other skin changes occur.Your doctor may also perform blood
                  tests to check the levels of Thyroid or other hormones, and
                  Vitamin B12.
